## Our Mission

The Potawatomi Digital Archive is dedicated to preserving, protecting, and sharing the rich cultural heritage of the Potawatomi people. We believe that every photograph, document, recording, and story is a precious thread in the tapestry of our collective history.

## Why Digital Preservation?

Physical materials deteriorate over time. Photographs fade, documents become brittle, and recordings degrade. By creating high-quality digital copies and storing them securely, we ensure that these irreplaceable materials will be available for future generations.

Digital preservation also makes these materials more accessible. Family members scattered across the country—or the world—can explore their heritage from anywhere with an internet connection.

## Our Approach

### Community-Driven

This archive is built by and for the Potawatomi community. We welcome contributions from tribal members, families, researchers, and institutions. Every voice adds to our understanding of who we are and where we come from.

### Culturally Respectful

We recognize that some materials may be culturally sensitive. We work with community elders and cultural advisors to ensure that all materials are shared appropriately and with respect for cultural protocols.

### Openly Accessible

Unless otherwise restricted, materials in the archive are freely accessible to anyone interested in learning about Potawatomi history and culture. We believe that sharing our heritage helps build understanding and connection.

## What We Collect

- **Photographs**: Historical and contemporary images of people, places, and events
- **Documents**: Letters, diaries, official records, treaties, and other written materials
